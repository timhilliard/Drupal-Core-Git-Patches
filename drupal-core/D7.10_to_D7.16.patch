+Drupal 7.16, 2012-10-17
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (Arbitrary PHP code execution and information
+  disclosure). See SA-CORE-2012-003.
+
+Drupal 7.15, 2012-08-01
+-----------------------
+- Introduced a 'user_password_reset_timeout' variable to allow the 24-hour
+  expiration for user password reset links to be adjusted (API addition).
+- Fixed database errors due to ambiguous column names that occurred when
+  EntityFieldQuery was used in certain situations.
+- Changed the drupal_array_get_nested_value() function to return a reference
+  (API addition).
+- Changed the System module's hook_block_info() implementation to assign the
+  "Main page content" and "System help" blocks to appropriate regions by
+  default and prevent error messages on the block administration page (data
+  structure change).
+- Fixed regression: Non-node entities couldn't be accessed with
+  EntityFieldQuery.
+- Fixed regression: Optional radio buttons with an empty, non-NULL default
+  value led to an illegal choice error when none were selected.
+- Reorganized the testing framework to split setUp() into specific sub-methods
+  and fix several regressions in the process.
+- Fixed bug which made it impossible to search for strings that have not been
+  translated into a particular language.
+- Renamed the "Field" column on the Manage Fields screen to "Field type", since
+  the former was confusing and inaccurate (UI change).
+- Performance improvement: Removed needless call to system_rebuild_module_data()
+  in field_sync_field_status(), greatly speeding up bulk module enable/disable.
+- Fixed bug which prevented notifications from being sent when core, module, and
+  theme updates are available.
+- Fixed bug which prevented sub-themes from inheriting the default values of
+  theme settings defined by the base theme.
+- Fixed bug which prevented the jQuery UI Datepicker from being localized.
+- Made Ajax alert dialogs respect error reporting settings.
+- Fixed bug which prevented image styles from being deleted on PHP 5.4.
+- Fixed bug: Language detection by domain only worked on port 80.
+- Fixed regression: The first plural index on a page was not calculated
+  correctly.
+- Introduced generic entity language support. Entities may now declare their
+  language property in hook_entity_info(), and modules working with entities
+  may access the language using entity_language() (API change:
+  http://drupal.org/node/1626346).
+- Added EntityFieldQuery support for taxonomy bundles.
+- Fixed issue where field form structure was incomplete if field_access()
+  returned FALSE. Instead of being incomplete, the form structure now has
+  #access set to FALSE and field form validation is skipped (data structure
+  change: http://drupal.org/node/1663020).
+- Fixed data loss issue due to field_has_data() returning inconsistent results.
+  The fix adds an optional DANGEROUS_ACCESS_CHECK_OPT_OUT tag to entity field
+  queries which field storage engines can respond to (API addition:
+  http://drupal.org/node/1597378).
+- Fixed notice: Undefined index: default_image in image_field_prepare_view()
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.14 2012-05-02
+----------------------
+- Fixed "integrity constraint" fatal errors when rebuilding registry.
+- Fixed custom logo and favicon functionality referencing incorrect paths.
+- Fixed DB Case Sensitivity: Allow BINARY attribute in MySQL.
+- Split field_bundle_settings out per bundle.
+- Improve UX for machine names for fields (UI change).
+- Fixed User pictures are not removed properly.
+- Fixed HTTPS sessions not working in all cases.
+- Fixed Regression: Required radios throw illegal choice error when none
+  selected.
+- Fixed allow autocompletion requests to include slashes.
+- Eliminate $user->cache and {session}.cache in favor of
+  $_SESSION['cache_expiration'][$bin] (Performance).
+- Fixed focus jumps to tab when pressing enter on a form element within tab.
+- Fixed race condition in locale() - duplicates in {locales_source}.
+- Fixed Missing "Default image" per field instance.
+- Quit clobbering people's work when they click the filter tips link
+- Form API #states: Fix conditionals to allow OR and XOR constructions.
+- Fixed Focus jumps to tab when pressing enter on a form element within tab.
+  (Accessibility)
+- Improved performance of node_access queries.
+- Fixed Fieldsets inside vertical tabs have no title and can't be collapsed.
+- Reduce size of cache_menu table (Performance).
+- Fixed unnecessary aggregation of CSS/JS (Performance).
+- Fixed taxonomy_autocomplete() produces SQL error for nonexistent field.
+- Fixed HTML filter is not run first by default, despite default weight.
+- Fixed Overlay does not work with prefixed URL paths.
+- Better debug info for field errors (string change).
+- Fixed Data corruption in comment IDs (results in broken threading on
+  PostgreSQL).
+- Fixed machine name not editable if every character is replaced.
+- Fixed user picture not appearing in comment preview (Markup change).
+- Added optional vid argument for taxonomy_get_term_by_name().
+- Fixed Invalid Unicode code range in PREG_CLASS_UNICODE_WORD_BOUNDARY fails
+  with PCRE 8.30.
+- Fixed {trigger_assignments()}.hook has only 32 characters, is too short.
+- Numerous fixes to run-tests.sh.
+- Fixed Tests in profiles/[name]/modules cannot be run and cannot use a
+  different profile for running tests.
+- Numerous JavaScript performance fixes.
+- Numerous documentation fixes.
+- Fixed All pager links have an 'active' CSS class.
+- Numerous upgrade path fixes; notably:
+  - system_update_7061() fails on inserting files with same name but different
+    case.
+  - system_update_7061() converts filepaths too aggressively.
+  - Trigger upgrade path: Node triggers removed when upgrading to 7-x from 6.25.
+
+Drupal 7.13 2012-05-02
+----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (Multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2012-002.
+
+Drupal 7.12, 2012-02-01
+----------------------
+- Fixed bug preventing custom menus from receiving an active trail.
+- Fixed hook_field_delete() no longer invoked during field_purge_data().
+- Fixed bug causing entity info cache to not be cleared with the rest of caches.
+- Fixed file_unmanaged_copy() fails with Drupal 7.7+ and safe_mode() or
+  open_basedir().
+- Fixed Nested transactions throw exceptions when they got out of scope.
+- Fixed bugs with the Return-Path when sending mail on both Windows and
+  non-Windows systems.
+- Fixed bug with DrupalCacheArray property visibility preventing others from
+  extending it (API change: http://drupal.org/node/1422264).
+- Fixed bug with handling of non-ASCII characters in file names (API change:
+  http://drupal.org/node/1424840).
+- Reconciled field maximum length with database column size in image and
+  aggregator modules.
+- Fixes to various core JavaScript files to allow for minification and
+  aggregation.
+- Fixed Prevent tests from deleting main installation's tables when
+  parent::setUp() is not called.
+- Fixed several Poll module bugs.
+- Fixed several Shortcut module bugs.
+- Added new hook_system_theme_info() to provide ability for contributed modules
+  to test theme functionality.
+- Added ability to cancel mail sending from hook_mail_alter().
+- Added support for configurable PDO connection options, enabling master-master
+  database replication.
+- Numerous improvements to tests and test runner to pave the way for faster test
+  runs.
+- Expanded test coverage.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Numerous performance improvements, including token replacement and render
+  cache.

- * instance, to theme a table, the theme hook name is 'table'. By default, this

+ *
+ * Most commonly, the first argument to this function is the name of the theme
+ * hook. For instance, to theme a taxonomy term, the theme hook name is
+ * 'taxonomy_term'. Modules register theme hooks within a hook_theme()
+ * implementation and provide a default implementation via a function named
+ * theme_HOOK() (e.g., theme_taxonomy_term()) or via a template file named
+ * according to the value of the 'template' key registered with the theme hook
+ * (see hook_theme() for details). Default templates are implemented with the
+ * PHPTemplate rendering engine and are named the same as the theme hook, with
+ * underscores changed to hyphens, so for the 'taxonomy_term' theme hook, the
+ * default template is 'taxonomy-term.tpl.php'.
+ *
+ * Themes may also register new theme hooks within a hook_theme()
+ * implementation, but it is more common for themes to override default
+ * implementations provided by modules than to register entirely new theme
+ * hooks. Themes can override a default implementation by implementing a
+ * function named THEME_HOOK() (for example, the 'bartik' theme overrides the
+ * default implementation of the 'menu_tree' theme hook by implementing a
+ * bartik_menu_tree() function), or by adding a template file within its folder
+ * structure that follows the template naming structure used by the theme's
+ * rendering engine (for example, since the Bartik theme uses the PHPTemplate
+ * rendering engine, it overrides the default implementation of the 'page' theme
+ * hook by containing a 'page.tpl.php' file within its folder structure).

+ * In the Field API, each field has a type, which determines what kind of data
+ * (integer, string, date, etc.) the field can hold, which settings it provides,
+ * and so on. The data type(s) accepted by a field are defined in
+ * hook_field_schema(); other basic properties of a field are defined in
+ * hook_field_info(). The other hooks below are called by the Field Attach API
+ * to perform field-type-specific actions.
  *
  * The Field Types API also defines two kinds of pluggable handlers: widgets
- * and formatters, which specify how the field appears in edit forms and in
- * displayed entities. Widgets and formatters can be implemented by a field-type
- * module for its own field types, or by a third-party module to extend the
- * behavior of existing field types.
- *
